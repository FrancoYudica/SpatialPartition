# SpatialPartition
Implementation and comparison of spatial partition algorithms

The purpose of this project is to compare and analyze the differences in performance, memory usage and adaptability of different spatial partition algorithms over a static scene.
The implemented algorithms are the following:
- Brute force / no optimization
- Static grid
- Quad tree
